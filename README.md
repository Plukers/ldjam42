# Pool Watch
No one likes to watch the bay. But everybody loves to watch the pool.
You made your passion to your job and became a lifeguard of a local swimming pool.

Your daily guests are swimmers who cannot swim. 
But that does not stop them from going into the pool. 
Watch them enjoy their time, but be careful. 
Help them out when they call you. 
Otherwise they will drown.
**So do your job and save them!**
