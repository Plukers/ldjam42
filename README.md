# Pool Watch
No one likes to watch the bay. But everybody loves to watch the pool.
You made your passion to your job and became a lifeguard of a local swimming pool.

Your daily guests are swimmers who cannot swim. 
But that does not stop them from going into the pool. 
Watch them enjoy their time, but be careful. 
Help them out when they call you. 
Otherwise they will drown.
**So do your job and save them!**

## Controls
As soon as a swimmer starts to wave to you, snip him to a ladder.
Click on him and drag the force line into the opposite direction of where you want him to go. 
The longer the line, the more force is applied. 

Swimmers who don't wave or dead swimmers won't leave the pool. 

You have lost as soon as the *death bar* is full.
